Key Components:

venv: This directory stores the Python virtual environment where your application's Python package dependencies are installed.

app: This package contains your Flask application's modules, templates, static files, and other components.

static: This directory is used by Flask to serve static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

templates: Contains HTML templates that define the structure of web pages rendered by your Flask application.

forms: This module holds your form classes, which use WTForms to handle form creation and validation.

data_visualization: Here, you'd include Python scripts that prepare and process data fetched from Neo4j for visualization on the frontend.

neo4j: Contains modules and functions for interacting with the Neo4j database, executing Cypher queries, and processing the results.

chatgpt: This module would handle logic related to processing questions that can't be answered directly by database queries, mimicking a ChatGPT-like dialogue interaction.

migrations: If you're using migrations to manage your Neo4j schema (which might be less common with graph databases), this directory would contain migration scripts.
tests: Contains test cases and suites for testing your application.

.env and .flaskenv: Files for environment-specific settings. .env is a general environment variable file, while .flaskenv is specifically used by Flask.

config.py: Central configuration file for the Flask app, where you define configurations for different environments (development, testing, production).

run.py: The entry point script to run your Flask app.

requirements.txt: Lists all Python package dependencies for your project.

This structure is just a starting point. Depending on your specific requirements and preferences, you might choose to organize it differently.
