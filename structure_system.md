Here's a high-level system structure for the intelligent querying and visualization system you described:

Let's break down each component:

1. Front-end:

   - User Interface (UI):
     - Search Page: Allows users to enter their queries and displays search results.
     - Research Data Page: Displays the map of science visualization for scientific research data.
     - Teaching Data Page: Displays the map of science visualization for teaching data.
   - UI Components:
     - Search Bar: Accepts user input for queries.
     - Result Display: Shows the search results or answers retrieved from the database or ChatGPT.
     - Data Visualization: Renders the interactive map of science visualizations.

2. Back-end:
   - Flask Application:
     - Routes: Defines the API endpoints for handling requests from the front-end.
     - Controllers: Contains the logic for processing requests, querying the database, and integrating with ChatGPT.
     - Services: Encapsulates the business logic and data manipulation operations.
   - Database (Neo4j):
     - Data Models: Defines the graph data models and relationships for storing data in Neo4j.
     - Cypher Queries: Contains the Cypher queries for retrieving data from the Neo4j database.
   - ChatGPT Integration:
     - API Client: Handles the communication with the ChatGPT API for generating answers.
     - Response Handling: Processes the responses received from ChatGPT and formats them for display.

The front-end interacts with the back-end through API calls. When a user submits a query, the front-end sends a request to the Flask application. The application routes the request to the appropriate controller, which then processes the query.

The controller first checks if the query can be answered using the data stored in the Neo4j database. It executes the relevant Cypher queries to retrieve the data. If the data is found, it is returned to the front-end for display.

If the query cannot be answered using the database, the controller sends a request to the ChatGPT API to generate an answer. The ChatGPT integration component handles the API communication and response processing. The generated answer is then returned to the front-end for display.

For the research data and teaching data visualizations, the front-end sends requests to the Flask application to fetch the relevant data from the Neo4j database. The application executes the appropriate Cypher queries and returns the data to the front-end. The front-end then uses the data visualization components to render the interactive map of science visualizations.

This system structure separates the concerns between the front-end and back-end, allowing for modular development and maintainability. The Flask application acts as the central controller, orchestrating the data flow between the front-end, database, and ChatGPT integration.
